<p><br><br></p>
<p>Welcome to this week's <em>DIY Filmmaker Digest</em> -- part syllabus, part mixtape, part fever dream of cinema's shifting ground. Below you will find: essays and interviews that ask what artists are tinkering with, what systems are breaking, and how you might improvise your own way forward. There's a mild New Mexico bias, plus podcasts, videos, and trailers to keep your queue weird and your outlook restless.</p>
<p>But first, a little business: we have <strong>two Kickstarters live</strong> for future Dust Wave projects (both doing quite well but still needing your support) -- the first one is for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/836858424/just-hang-on-a-short-film-about-survival-choice-and-hope">Just Hang On</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chelseaambrosemua">Chelsea Ambrose</a>'s short drama about survival, choice, and hope. Chelsea is a longtime makeup and special effects artist, but this is her first time writing and directing a short film. <strong>There's 7 days left in the campaign,</strong> so <strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/836858424/just-hang-on-a-short-film-about-survival-choice-and-hope">go support Chelsea's project!</a></strong></p>
<p>The second is for Jeanette Aguilar Harris's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/dancing-through-the-darkness-an-alzheimers-ballet-story">Dancing Through the Darkness</a>. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeanetteaguilarharris">Jeanette</a> is a longtime actor and dancer and her short film is about faith, family, and the power of dance in the face of early onset Alzheimer's. <strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/dancing-through-the-darkness-an-alzheimers-ballet-story">Go support Jeanette's project!</a></strong></p>
<p>Also -- I've been having a great time meeting filmmakers at the <a href="https://santafe.film/">Santa Fe International Film Festival</a>. Shout out to <a href="https://instagram.com/johanstavsjo">Johan Stavsjö</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/makaiofrazier/">Makaio Frazier</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/yadoodles_96">Yadid Licht</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sarahadelman1/">Sarah Adelman</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/otisblum/">Otis Blum</a> -- much success with your films and endeavors. And of course to all the organizers, programmers, volunteers, and everyone that has made the festival go.</p>
<p>And one more kudos to my friends <a href="https://www.adrianpijoan.net/index.html">Adrián Pijoan</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ben_carndt_/">Ben Arndt</a> for <a href="/project/pandora-s-greenhouse.html">their</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBHDJckI6tc">films</a> getting selected to screen at the festival -- truly creative, kind, brilliant filmmakers. This is just the beginning!</p>
<p>And now, the digest:</p>

<img class="w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded mb-2" src="/img/digest/2025-10-13/original-cadence-a-conversation-with-diane-keaton.jpg" alt="Illustration for Original Cadence: A Conversation with Diane Keaton" loading="lazy" decoding="async">

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://cinephiliabeyond.org/original-cadence-a-conversation-with-diane-keaton" target="_blank">Original Cadence: A Conversation with Diane Keaton</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“I had a lot of ambition right from the get go ... I faced rejection with blind determination and I didn't stop.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keaton's reflections on acting resist the myth of &quot;natural charisma&quot; -- she frames craft as repetition, risk, and patience rather than innate charm.</li>
<li>The conversation underscores how the industry flattens individuality; Keaton insists on the value of strangeness as labor, not quirk.</li>
<li>Her emphasis on self-direction mirrors the struggles of filmmakers outside studio systems trying to define their own pace and texture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Study performances that feel lived-in rather than polished; rehearse with silence and hesitation as tools.</li>
<li>Write and direct with a willingness to preserve awkwardness -- it's often where honesty hides.</li>
<li>Revisit your own footage with an eye for rhythm, not perfection; what feels &quot;off&quot; might actually be what's real.</li>
</ul>

<img class="w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded mb-2" src="/img/digest/2025-10-13/mike-flanagan-movie-recommendations.jpg" alt="Illustration for Mike Flanagan's Movie Recommendations for Horror Fans" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<div class="p-3">
<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://nofilmschool.com/mike-flanagan-movie-recommendations" target="_blank">Mike Flanagan's Movie Recommendations for Horror Fans</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“You might be a big horror fan, like so many of us around here, or you might be an aspiring horror filmmaker. Either way, this list is a great place to start learning what works in the genre.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flanagan's list reads as a personal syllabus -- horror as empathy training, not sadism.</li>
<li>His focus on dread over gore reclaims the genre as a space for emotion, grief, and ethics.</li>
<li>The recommendations remind filmmakers that horror's power lies in human recognition, not CGI escalation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build horror from emotional truth -- map your own fears before designing scares.</li>
<li>Rewatch one of his picks with sound off; study how framing alone creates unease.</li>
<li>Collaborate with actors to explore vulnerability, not shock -- terror is relational.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/steam-adult-games-physical-releases-parfum-nostalgique" target="_blank">As Steam cracks down on adult games, one dev urges taking back control</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“Rosario's dreamed of being a game developer since he was 7. He's not about to let some invisible force entirely what happens next.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Platform censorship isn't moral hygiene -- it's a profit mechanism that silences niche creators.</li>
<li><strong>The dev's argument reframes independence as material control</strong>: owning distribution, audience, and archives.</li>
<li>The piece parallels the struggles of indie filmmakers fighting algorithmic invisibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diversify where you publish your work -- host on your own site, or use decentralized media tools.</li>
<li>Archive your films offline; digital access is never guaranteed.</li>
<li>Talk to peers about collective hosting solutions; solidarity builds resilience.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“The collaboration between director Béla Tarr, editor Ágnes Hranitzky, and writer László Krasznahorkai has produced many such degraded miracles.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tarr's cinema insists on slowness as political resistance -- attention as a refusal of spectacle.</li>
<li>The collaboration between Tarr, Hranitzky, and Krasznahorkai models art as collective labor.</li>
<li>Their world isn't hopeless -- it's humane in its endurance of time, decay, and work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Film a scene in real time without cutting; practice patience as aesthetic.</li>
<li>Revisit Tarr's tracking shots -- not for imitation, but to feel duration as emotion.</li>
<li>Build your crew as a circle, not a hierarchy; collaboration is philosophy, not logistics.</li>
</ul>

<div class="p-3">
<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://letterboxd.com/journal/wes-anderson-criterion-collection-interview" target="_blank">Magnificent Andersons: Wes Anderson on 25 years of filmmaking craft and collaboration -- and his new Criterion set</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“Somewhere around the time when we were doing The Royal Tenenbaums or The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, I started thinking, 'It seems like the characters in my movies might walk out of one movie and join the characters in another.'”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anderson emphasizes continuity -- style as sustained curiosity rather than repetition.</li>
<li>His collaboration with craftspeople underscores how aesthetics emerge from shared vocabulary, not command.</li>
<li>The conversation reminds artists that refinement doesn't have to mean control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on what parts of your visual identity you've grown from, and what you've just repeated.</li>
<li>Build long-term creative relationships; community deepens design.</li>
<li>Rewatch early Anderson films and compare their looseness to your own first works.</li>

<div class="p-3">
<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/life-is-strange-10th-anniversary-final-choice" target="_blank"><em>Life is Strange's</em> final choice is still haunting me a decade later</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“It was basically the Trolley Problem, except it revealed that half the playerbase, myself included, are unabashed sociopaths and will happily flatten a town if it means getting to hang on to our main squeeze.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game remains a parable about empathy as labor -- the cost of caring in a broken system.</li>
<li>Its moral design invites reflection on responsibility, not winning.</li>
<li>It continues to resonate with anyone trying to hold onto humanity in tech-mediated life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on how your work asks viewers to choose -- and what those choices reveal.</li>
<li><strong>Use interactivity metaphorically</strong>: editing is its own moral fork.</li>
<li>Revisit endings that leave tension unresolved; trust discomfort.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“Alan's brilliant idea here was he wanted to put us (the audience) through the same test.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The essay reframes paranoia as an aesthetic -- control rendered beautiful.</li>
<li>It historicizes how political fear becomes film grammar in the American century.</li>
<li>The &quot;test film&quot; becomes metaphor for a culture rehearsing violence as normalcy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze your use of surveillance shots -- who's watching whom?</li>
<li>Draw from political context; film is always evidence of its moment.</li>
<li>Craft mood from contradiction -- beauty can indict as well as seduce.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“Control, permission for use, and compensation is a fundamental right of these workers. Anything less than the protection of creators and their rights is unacceptable.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The panic around Sora 2 reveals Hollywood's dependence on technological spectacle, not storytelling labor.</li>
<li>Agencies' &quot;concern&quot; masks a scramble to own creative tools rather than share them.</li>
<li>The real risk isn't AI's power -- it's who profits from its displacement of human workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss with collaborators how to protect collective authorship as tech shifts.</li>
<li>Build transparency clauses into your contracts about AI-generated materials.</li>

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/amazon-mgm-studios-united-artists-heat-2-leonardo-dicaprio-1236572358/" target="_blank"><em>Heat 2</em> Lands At United Artists With DiCaprio Eyed; Movie Gains Steam</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“<em>Heat 2</em> isn't a sequel in the usual sense -- it's the same pulse, the same precision, but stretched across time, tracing how obsession and professionalism consume every life they touch.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The sequel's scale underscores how nostalgia fuels consolidation -- new art as brand continuity.</li>
<li><em>Heat 2</em> risks polishing what was once jagged; the corporate machine reworks memory for market.</li>
<li><strong>The deal signals a deeper truth</strong>: legacy IP now replaces mentorship as Hollywood's ladder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revisit your old work -- what stories deserve evolution, not repetition?</li>
<li>Seek collective financing over legacy partnerships when possible.</li>
<li>Watch <em>Heat</em> again and ask what tension feels impossible to replicate -- that's the gap where new art can live.</li>

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://hyperallergic.com/1048506/lu-yang-video-game-of-life-momi" target="_blank">The Video Game of Life</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“For Lu, the medium of play -- so often dismissed as mere entertainment -- becomes a vehicle for awakening, translating Buddhist philosophy into digital form.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lu Yang's work challenges the commodified self -- avatars as extensions of capitalist spectacle rather than liberation.</li>
<li>The exhibit asks whether technological transcendence only deepens alienation from the body and labor.</li>
<li>By collapsing digital play and spiritual imagery, the piece confronts how &quot;immortality&quot; has become a corporate fantasy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think critically about how your filmmaking tools mirror systems of power -- what kind of subjects do they privilege?</li>
<li>Create work that questions rather than celebrates &quot;limitless creation&quot; tech; tension is fertile.</li>
<li>Document your own screen habits -- how does your digital gaze shape your camera's eye?</li>

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/drew-struzan-dies-movie-posters-1236400361" target="_blank">Drew Struzan Dead: Poster Artist Was 78</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“He never failed to capture a film's tone perfectly, often focusing heavily on its characters -- layering a sprawling ensemble cast into a single image was a Struzan specialty.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Struzan's legacy reaffirms illustration as an act of storytelling, not decoration.</li>
<li>His compositions translated emotion into mythic imagery -- a reminder that marketing can be art when it's made by workers, not algorithms.</li>
<li>His death marks another turn in Hollywood's shift away from tactile imagination toward digital sameness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hand-sketch your next poster concept before touching Photoshop -- find shape through gesture.</li>
<li>Revisit Struzan's posters to study balance and texture; note how faces carry light.</li>
<li>Support artists still working analog -- commission local painters for your projects.</li>

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/strange-days-30-years-anniversary-katherine-bigelow" target="_blank"><em>Strange Days</em> landed Katherine Bigelow in director jail, but it's still worth watching 3 decades later</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“Strange Days is a noir-soaked science-fiction thriller set against a backdrop of racial tension, police brutality, sexual assault, and a disruptive new virtual reality device called a SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device).”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bigelow's punishment for ambition exposes the gendered economics of risk in Hollywood.</li>
<li><em>Strange Days</em> remains prophetic about surveillance, spectacle, and voyeuristic guilt.</li>
<li>The film's failure became a cautionary tale -- how the system disciplines creativity that critiques itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Watch <em>Strange Days</em> through today's algorithmic lens; note what's become prophecy.</li>
<li>Study Bigelow's pacing and framing to understand tension without moral compromise.</li>
<li>Reflect on how your own bold choices might be misunderstood -- make them anyway.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/the-strangers-director-bryan-bertino-interview-vicious" target="_blank"><em>The Strangers</em> prepped <em>Vicious'</em> director for a career of creative battles</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“It's always been a battle for me, because I'm trying to do certain things ... I have a voice.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bertino's story shows how horror directors often survive on emotional endurance, not industry grace.</li>
<li>His reflections reveal the grind of indie horror -- a mix of isolation, resilience, and DIY ethics.</li>
<li>The piece reframes fear as a creative resource, not just a cinematic mood.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build small horror sets; use limitation as energy, not obstacle.</li>
<li>Journal what scares you -- and what you avoid shooting.</li>
<li>Trade gear, not competition; resource sharing sustains longevity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/all-you-need-is-kill-anime-trailer-edge-of-tomorrow" target="_blank"><em>All You Need Is Kill</em> is the anime for Tom Cruise fans</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“Studio4°C and director Kenichiro Akimoto give the bleak sci-fi story a much more colorful and energetic aesthetic than Doug Liman's live-action adaptation.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The adaptation demonstrates how repetition in narrative mirrors repetition in labor -- a loop without liberation.</li>
<li>Its militarized spectacle critiques and perpetuates the fantasy of eternal productivity.</li>
<li>The work hints at the exhaustion beneath entertainment's polish.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with cyclical structure -- how does repetition change emotion?</li>
<li><strong>Deconstruct your own process</strong>: what creative &quot;loops&quot; are you stuck in?</li>
<li>Try cutting a short with recycled footage to explore time as a material.</li>

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2025/10/05/serene-and-delirious-miguel-gomes" target="_blank">The Films of of Miguel Gomes</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“Juvenile, amoral, and quite carefree about wasting your time, Gomes's films also open up a horizon of total freedom ... his works catalyze something else: a porous, unfixed sensation of political joy.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gomes' cinema turns play into critique -- joy as rebellion against fatalism.</li>
<li>His narratives blur myth and reportage, suggesting politics can exist in whimsy.</li>
<li>The piece sees his work as an antidote to cynicism, without ignoring the grind of making art under austerity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Infuse your scripts with humor that bites -- laughter as structure, not relief.</li>
<li>Let your location dictate your story; realism grows from place, not budget.</li>
<li>Watch Gomes to study editing that feels like dreaming in daylight.</li>

<h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/8931-deeper-into-altman" target="_blank">Deeper into Altman</a></h4><p></p>
<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“You might say there are significantly more deep cuts in Altman's career than there are classics -- which is saying something since he has quite a few classics.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Altman's chaos was never disorder -- it was democracy rendered audible.</li>
<li>His overlapping dialogue and ensemble focus built a cinema of coexistence.</li>
<li>The essay frames him as a worker among workers, shaping meaning through openness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Film collective spaces -- capture how sound and speech collide.</li>
<li>Resist narrative dominance; let background stories breathe.</li>
<li>Rewatch <em>Nashville</em> and study how noise becomes empathy.</li>

<p></p><blockquote class="mb-2">“What a dull chase it would have been had I stuck to what was probable.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Friedkin's work captures the tension between realism and chaos -- art born from streets, not storyboards.</li>
<li><strong>The essay reminds readers that grit used to mean ethics</strong>: the filmmaker as chronicler, not stylist.</li>
<li>Revisiting it now exposes how corporate action cinema sterilized danger.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Study how Friedkin choreographs chaos -- movement before meaning.</li>
<li>Shoot handheld in public spaces to relearn risk.</li>
<li><strong>Reclaim &quot;gritty&quot; as a moral stance</strong>: honesty over gloss.</li>

<blockquote class="mb-2">“What we learned is that people will support your film if they feel personally invested -- not if they're just told to.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with small, meaningful calls-to-action in your credits -- something personal that connects the audience to your process, not just your Venmo.</li>
<li><strong>Think about how to build investment <em>before</em> release</strong>: what stories, struggles, or creative stakes can make people feel part of your film's journey?</li>
<li>Create a micro-campaign around one film element that invites reciprocity, not guilt -- make it an exchange, not a handout.</li>

<blockquote class="mb-2">“His dreamers are so committed to their lies that they dream their lies into being truth.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write a character whose lie becomes their art -- test how long the audience will believe it before it collapses.</li>
<li>Reflect on one &quot;beautiful lie&quot; you tell yourself about filmmaking -- how does it fuel or limit your work?</li>
<li>Shoot something that balances chivalry with delusion -- a scene where belief itself feels cinematic.</li>

<blockquote class="mb-2">“I'm interested in the moment when discomfort becomes revelation -- when something ugly suddenly turns sacred.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a short scene where discomfort is the point -- not to shock, but to let an ugly truth breathe.</li>
<li>Study how your camera reacts to shame or silence; these are the cracks where revelation hides.</li>
<li>Build one sequence where the sacred and grotesque share the same frame.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="mb-2">“Plays are about where on stage everybody stands -- it's choreography for control.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on how the discipline of movement mirrors the push-pull between structure and creative freedom in filmmaking.</li>
<li>Consider what happens when authority tries to &quot;direct&quot; spontaneity out of a performance -- what would it mean to protect chaos as part of your process?</li>
<li>Study how collaboration between equals resists the myth of the singular auteur -- and how that ethos can inform your own sets.</li>

<blockquote class="mb-2">“We'll summarize and generalize our experiences until there's nothing left of the real thing.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on how automation reshapes creativity -- what happens when labor, experimentation, and even boredom are optimized out of existence?</li>
<li>Consider how your filmmaking process can resist &quot;AI slop&quot; by embracing friction, failure, and material texture.</li>
<li>Think about collective authorship -- how can artists and crews reclaim creative ownership in an increasingly extractive digital economy?</li>

<p>And that's this week's digest. I want to give another special shout out to all of <a href="/about.html">Dust Wave's amazing filmmakers</a> -- we have a special group of creative folks that make movies no matter what. Beauty and joy is our pursuit.</p>
<p>I don't have a Letterboxd or anything, but here are a few movies I've watched (or rewatched) and enjoyed recently:</p>

<p>As always, everything we share is chosen with the same compass: <strong>collectivity over ego, experiments over formulas, access over gatekeeping.</strong></p>
<p>Keep making what only you can make, keep passing the torch sideways, and keep stitching together the world we actually want to live in.</p>
