          <li>A positive, empathetic, supportive, collaborative, free and open creative environment is the best one to help us, both collectively and individually, achieve our artistic goals and ambitions.</li></br>
          <li>Every project we do will provide value collectively and individually. We credit individuals for their contribution, but we share in the success of our projects collectively.</li></br>
          <li>Each member of each project is valuable and important, and should be treated as such.</br></br>
          <li>We support each other. Together, we're stronger and more courageous.</li></br>
          <li>We strive to communicate frequently and openly. We are open and honest with each other. We are also careful to be critical in a constructive and respectful manner.</li></br>
          <li>We recognize that organization and intentionality are critical parts of the success of every project. Each person will make the effort to read messages in group chats, respond to requests in a timely manner, and keep the big picture in mind.</li></br>
          <li>Not everyone needs to (or can) be involved in every project, but everyone needs to offer their support and constructive feedback if asked.</li></br>
          <li>We strive to operate democratically and in a decentralized way as much as possible.</li></br>
          <li>We strive to assume the best of each other, have patience with each other, and commit to earning each other's trust.</li></br>
          <li>If we start a project, we strive to finish the project.</li></br>
          <li>We strive to grow our individual skills independently and bring that learning back to the collective.</li></br>
          <li>We are committed to fundraising efforts that will cover the costs of our projects, and eventually compensate each artist for their valuable time.</li></ol>
