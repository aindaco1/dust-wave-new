[Dive-In Movies](https://diveinmovies.xyz) is simple — a pool adventure with a movie screening at the [Hotel Zazz](https://www.hotelzazz.com) pool! There’s a bar (courtesy of [Z Lounge](https://www.hotelzazz.com/zlounge)), popcorn and other goodies for sale. Mingling and swimming before the movie, swimming and chilling during. Doors open at 7:00pm, movie starts at sunset.

From May 2 to August 29, 2024, along with our awesome partners at [Sopapilla Productions](https://www.sopapillaproductions.com), we screened movies every Thursday night (except July 4th).
