Welcome to this week's *DIY Filmmaker Digest* — part syllabus, part mixtape, part fever dream of cinema's shifting ground. Below you will find: essays and interviews that ask what artists are tinkering with, what systems are breaking, and how you might improvise your own way forward. There's a mild New Mexico bias, plus podcasts, videos, and trailers to keep your queue weird and your outlook restless.

<br>

But first, a little business: we have **a Kickstarter live right now** for a future Dust Wave project -- our friend [Melissa Flores](https://www.instagram.com/melissaflores0) needs your help to get [Tethered Girl](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/tethered-girl-a-fantasy-western-short) funded! Melissa is a Mexican-American filmmaker and Tethered Girl is her latest short film, a fantasy western performed entirely in Spanish with an all-Spanish-speaking crew! Don't worry _gringos_, there will be English subtitles 😉.

The Kickstarter ends **Friday, December 12th at 11:59 PM MT**. **[Support Melissa and Tethered Girl before it's too late!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/tethered-girl-a-fantasy-western-short)**

And that's this week's digest. We just posted pictures from our most recent showcase, [**_Attack of the 50 Ft. Dust Wave!_**](/project/attack-of-the-50-ft-dust-wave.html) -- go check them out! What an amazing night, I'm still buzzing from it weeks afterwards. **Building community and supporting emerging filmmakers** is what we're all about, and it was on full display on that night. And we're far from done!

**2026.** _You're not ready for what's coming._

I don't have a Letterboxd or anything, but here are a few movies I've watched (or rewatched) and enjoyed recently:

As always, everything we share is chosen with the same compass: **collectivity over ego, experiments over formulas, access over gatekeeping.**

Keep making what only you can make, keep passing the torch sideways, and keep stitching together the world we actually want to live in.
