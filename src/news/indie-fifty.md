New Mexico has spent a rough average of [**$100 million a year** on film tax credits over the past five years](https://nmfilm.com/assets/uploads/NM-Film-2025-Report-Final-003.pdf). And more often than not, [the big studios and streamers reap the benefits](https://edd.newmexico.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HB547.pdf).

And big productions are great! They bring jobs, infrastructure, and attention. But ... **what fills the gaps between the giants?** And **what happens to the local filmmakers who want to tell stories right here, right now?**

Here's a modest proposal: **The Indie 50 Fund**. A carve-out of just **1% of the state's annual film tax credit (~$1,000,000)** to support small but mighty film projects. Efficient, effective, and all about us New Mexicans.

Here's how it works:

- **50 films funded each year** at **$20,000 each**  
- **1 per filmmaker max**  
- Every project must bring a **50% cash match ($10,000)** through crowdfunding, loans, or private investment  
- **All grant + match money must be spent in New Mexico**  
- **80% reserved for NM residents**  
- **20% open to filmmakers from elsewhere**, if they pledge to **house pre-production, production, and post-production in New Mexico** and use an **all-New Mexico cast and crew**
- **Must carry film production insurance and abide by industry safety standards**. All cast and crew must sign [A Pledge to Sarah](https://www.isafetvandfilm.com/sarah-s-pledge)
- Selection based on **creativity, storytelling, feasibility** with a preference for **filmmakers of modest means**  
- **First dollars pay union Tier 1 wages** to cast and crew  

</br>

### Why This Fund?
<br>

Because it works on multiple levels:

- **Paychecks first**. ~$850,000 in wages each year, equating to **over 2,400 paid days** at fair rates.
- **Vendor spending**. ~$650,000 spent on NM rentals, props, catering, hotels, fuel, and services.
- **Total direct NM spend**. **$1.5 million annually** (grants + required match).  
- **Leverage built in**. Every public dollar requires private cash alongside it. No in-kind loopholes, no funny money.

### Why It Matters for New Mexico
<br>

- **Infrastructure stays alive**. Between Netflix shows and studio shoots, crews and vendors need continuity. Smaller films keep the lights on, the gear moving, and the skills sharp.  
- **Brain drain slows**. Too many NM filmmakers leave for LA or New York because they can't get a first feature off the ground here. This fund builds a **pipeline**. Make your first film here, make your second film here, build your career here.  
- **Marketing power**. Microbudget films dominate **Sundance, SXSW, Tribeca**. Imagine festival programs, press kits, and distribution deals all stamped **“Made in New Mexico.”** That's free advertising and a global reputation boost.  
- **Equity and access**. By prioritizing storytellers of limited means, we're not just creating movies -- we're opening doors that otherwise stay locked.

### Message to the Haters
<br>

Some critics might dismiss The Indie 50 as government welfare or (cue ominous music) <i>**socialism**</i>. To which we say: <i>**so what?**</i> We <i>already</i> practice a form of collective investment through the Film Production Tax Credit program.

**And it works.** The tax credit has created thousands of jobs, supported billions in production spending, and built the infrastructure that brought Netflix and NBC/Universal here in the first place.

What we're proposing isn't radical. **It's simply ensuring that a sliver of this proven program supports New Mexico's own filmmakers.**

Right now, most of the benefit flows to the big guys. By carving out just 1%, **we'd have an immeasurable impact on the local independent film scene.** The cultural return — dozens of films made here every year, voices rooted in New Mexico telling their stories — would be enormous. And the marketing effect of fifty films stamped "Made in New Mexico" hitting festivals, streaming platforms, and press outlets annually? <i>**That's the kind of visibility you can't buy.**</i>

<br>

### Message to the Haters II
<br>

Another line you might hear: <i>"But are there even enough filmmakers in New Mexico to make this fund worthwhile?"</i> To which we say, with love and exasperation: <i>**that's bullshit.**</i>

[Dust Wave](/) itself is living proof. We've built a **community of dozens of filmmakers who are constantly creating, crowdfunding, hustling, and pushing projects forward with scraps of money and a whole lot of grit.** And we're not unique — collectives, students, emerging directors, writers, and crews are everywhere in this state.

**What they lack isn't ideas or passion, it's access to resources.** Give them even modest support, and you'll see fifty films a year become not just possible, <i>but inevitable.</i>

<br>

### The Future of Filmmaking
<br>

**Big productions are important, but they don't define the future.** Independent filmmakers do. The next generation of directors, writers, producers, and cinematographers are cutting their teeth on **scrappy, resourceful indie films**. If New Mexico wants to be the film capital not just of today but of tomorrow, we need to stake that claim now.

<i>__This fund is how we do it.__</i>

</br>

### Let's Do Something About It Then!
<br>

We're taking this idea to to state legislators. But ... they need to know that filmmakers, artists, and New Mexicans want this.

With just 1% of New Mexico's film credit program, we can build a permanent **$1.5M indie film economy** every year.
