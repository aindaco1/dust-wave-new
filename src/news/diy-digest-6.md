Welcome to this week’s *DIY Filmmaker Digest* — part syllabus, part mixtape, part fever dream of cinema’s shifting ground. Below you will find: essays and interviews that ask what artists are tinkering with, what systems are breaking, and how you might improvise your own way forward. There’s a mild New Mexico bias, plus podcasts, videos, and trailers to keep your queue weird and your outlook restless.  

</br>


But first, a little business: we have **a Kickstarter live right now** for a future Dust Wave project -- our friend [Melissa Flores](https://www.instagram.com/melissaflores0) needs your help to get [Tethered Girl](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/tethered-girl-a-fantasy-western-short) funded! Melissa is a Mexican-American filmmaker and Tethered Girl is her latest short film, a fantasy western performed entirely in Spanish with an all-Spanish-speaking crew! Don't worry _gringos_, there will be English subtitles 😉. **[Support Melissa and Tethered Girl!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/tethered-girl-a-fantasy-western-short)**

Also -- we're showing **[Rosemary's Baby at the Guild Cinema](https://shop.dustwave.xyz/#rosemary-1)!** Come join us on **November 7th at 10:30pm** for a screening of the 1967 psychological horror classic -- **buy a ticket [here](https://shop.dustwave.xyz/#rosemary-1).**

And now, the digest:

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“A combination of the breakdown of the Hollywood studio system, the decline of censorship, and the rise of wildly -- and luridly -- creative filmmakers across the world looking to cash in on sex and violence made 1960 the year of the modern horror film.”</blockquote>

        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>

          <li>A solid, unique point of view is crucial for a film's identity and audience connection.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The value of film competitions extends beyond winning; networking and experience are key.</li>
          <li>Film competitions are networking gigs disguised as meritocracies -- treat them accordingly.</li>

        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>

          <li>Research producers who champion writer-driven projects, not just those who control purse strings.</li>

        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Map out the 'click into place' moments of a movie you love. Identify at least 3 key setups and payoffs within the first 30 minutes, then apply a similar structure to your current project.</li>
          <li>Host a workshop with fellow DIY filmmakers to dissect and discuss the exposition of a well-regarded film. Use Fight Club as a case study to understand how the introduction can make or break audience engagement.</li>
          <li>Experiment with non-linear storytelling in your next script or film project. Draft a scene that could work as a gripping opening and also tie back into your story's climax or resolution, mirroring Fight Club's technique.</li>

And that's this week's digest. I want to give another special shout out to all of [Dust Wave's amazing filmmakers](/about.html) -- we have a special group of creative folks that make movies no matter what. Beauty and joy is our pursuit.

I don't have a Letterboxd or anything, but here are a few movies I've watched (or rewatched) and enjoyed recently:

As always, everything we share is chosen with the same compass: **collectivity over ego, experiments over formulas, access over gatekeeping.**

Keep making what only you can make, keep passing the torch sideways, and keep stitching together the world we actually want to live in.
