Written and directed by collective member [Bailey Grady](https://www.instagram.com/londone_fog), a talented up-and-coming filmmaker, Long Night is a horror/romance short about Connor, an aspiring filmmaker who wants nothing more than to get her mother-in-law's blessing and propose to her girlfriend, Sophie. However, the night she's set to accomplish both, she's bitten by a werewolf on the walk home! Will she be able to push through, or will she become a monster during dinner?

Our projects are typically passion projects, and this one is no different — however, because of the equipment and special effects needs of the project, we needed to raise extra funds to make it the best film it could be.

So we reached out to our community, and [achieved our goal one week early!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/long-night-0)
