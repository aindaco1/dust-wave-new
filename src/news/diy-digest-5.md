Welcome to this week's *DIY Filmmaker Digest* -- part syllabus, part mixtape, part fever dream of cinema's shifting ground. Below you will find: essays and interviews that ask what artists are tinkering with, what systems are breaking, and how you might improvise your own way forward. There's a mild New Mexico bias, plus podcasts, videos, and trailers to keep your queue weird and your outlook restless.

But first, a little business: we have **two Kickstarters live** for future Dust Wave projects (both doing quite well but still needing your support) -- the first one is for [Just Hang On](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/836858424/just-hang-on-a-short-film-about-survival-choice-and-hope), [Chelsea Ambrose](https://www.instagram.com/chelseaambrosemua)'s short drama about survival, choice, and hope. Chelsea is a longtime makeup and special effects artist, but this is her first time writing and directing a short film. **There's 7 days left in the campaign,** so **[go support Chelsea's project!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/836858424/just-hang-on-a-short-film-about-survival-choice-and-hope)**

The second is for Jeanette Aguilar Harris's [Dancing Through the Darkness](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/dancing-through-the-darkness-an-alzheimers-ballet-story). [Jeanette](https://www.instagram.com/jeanetteaguilarharris) is a longtime actor and dancer and her short film is about faith, family, and the power of dance in the face of early onset Alzheimer's. **[Go support Jeanette's project!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/dancing-through-the-darkness-an-alzheimers-ballet-story)**

Also -- I've been having a great time meeting filmmakers at the [Santa Fe International Film Festival](https://santafe.film/). Shout out to [Johan Stavsjö](https://instagram.com/johanstavsjo), [Makaio Frazier](https://www.instagram.com/makaiofrazier/), [Yadid Licht](https://instagram.com/yadoodles_96), [Sarah Adelman](https://www.instagram.com/sarahadelman1/), and [Otis Blum](https://www.instagram.com/otisblum/) -- much success with your films and endeavors. And of course to all the organizers, programmers, volunteers, and everyone that has made the festival go.

And one more kudos to my friends [Adrián Pijoan](https://www.adrianpijoan.net/index.html) and [Ben Arndt](https://www.instagram.com/ben_carndt_/) for [their](/project/pandora-s-greenhouse.html) [films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBHDJckI6tc) getting selected to screen at the festival -- truly creative, kind, brilliant filmmakers. This is just the beginning!

And now, the digest:

        <h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://cinephiliabeyond.org/original-cadence-a-conversation-with-diane-keaton" target="_blank">Original Cadence: A Conversation with Diane Keaton</a></h4>
        
        <blockquote class="mb-2">“I had a lot of ambition right from the get go ... I faced rejection with blind determination and I didn't stop.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keaton's reflections on acting resist the myth of "natural charisma" -- she frames craft as repetition, risk, and patience rather than innate charm.</li>
          <li>The conversation underscores how the industry flattens individuality; Keaton insists on the value of strangeness as labor, not quirk.</li>
          <li>Her emphasis on self-direction mirrors the struggles of filmmakers outside studio systems trying to define their own pace and texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Study performances that feel lived-in rather than polished; rehearse with silence and hesitation as tools.</li>
          <li>Write and direct with a willingness to preserve awkwardness -- it's often where honesty hides.</li>
          <li>Revisit your own footage with an eye for rhythm, not perfection; what feels "off" might actually be what's real.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <img class="w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded mb-2"      src="/img/digest/2025-10-13/mike-flanagan-movie-recommendations.jpg" alt="Illustration for Mike Flanagan's Movie Recommendations for Horror Fans"      loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <div class="p-3">
        <h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://nofilmschool.com/mike-flanagan-movie-recommendations" target="_blank">Mike Flanagan's Movie Recommendations for Horror Fans</a></h4>
        
        <blockquote class="mb-2">“You might be a big horror fan, like so many of us around here, or you might be an aspiring horror filmmaker. Either way, this list is a great place to start learning what works in the genre.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flanagan's list reads as a personal syllabus -- horror as empathy training, not sadism.</li>
          <li>His focus on dread over gore reclaims the genre as a space for emotion, grief, and ethics.</li>
          <li>The recommendations remind filmmakers that horror's power lies in human recognition, not CGI escalation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build horror from emotional truth -- map your own fears before designing scares.</li>
          <li>Rewatch one of his picks with sound off; study how framing alone creates unease.</li>
          <li>Collaborate with actors to explore vulnerability, not shock -- terror is relational.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h4 class="mb-2"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/steam-adult-games-physical-releases-parfum-nostalgique" target="_blank">As Steam cracks down on adult games, one dev urges taking back control</a></h4>
        
        <blockquote class="mb-2">“Rosario's dreamed of being a game developer since he was 7. He's not about to let some invisible force entirely what happens next.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Platform censorship isn't moral hygiene -- it's a profit mechanism that silences niche creators.</li>
          <li><strong>The dev's argument reframes independence as material control</strong>: owning distribution, audience, and archives.</li>
          <li>The piece parallels the struggles of indie filmmakers fighting algorithmic invisibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diversify where you publish your work -- host on your own site, or use decentralized media tools.</li>
          <li>Archive your films offline; digital access is never guaranteed.</li>
          <li>Talk to peers about collective hosting solutions; solidarity builds resilience.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“The collaboration between director Béla Tarr, editor Ágnes Hranitzky, and writer László Krasznahorkai has produced many such degraded miracles.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tarr's cinema insists on slowness as political resistance -- attention as a refusal of spectacle.</li>
          <li>The collaboration between Tarr, Hranitzky, and Krasznahorkai models art as collective labor.</li>
          <li>Their world isn't hopeless -- it's humane in its endurance of time, decay, and work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Film a scene in real time without cutting; practice patience as aesthetic.</li>
          <li>Revisit Tarr's tracking shots -- not for imitation, but to feel duration as emotion.</li>
          <li>Build your crew as a circle, not a hierarchy; collaboration is philosophy, not logistics.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“Somewhere around the time when we were doing The Royal Tenenbaums or The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, I started thinking, 'It seems like the characters in my movies might walk out of one movie and join the characters in another.'”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Anderson emphasizes continuity -- style as sustained curiosity rather than repetition.</li>
          <li>His collaboration with craftspeople underscores how aesthetics emerge from shared vocabulary, not command.</li>
          <li>The conversation reminds artists that refinement doesn't have to mean control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reflect on what parts of your visual identity you've grown from, and what you've just repeated.</li>
          <li>Build long-term creative relationships; community deepens design.</li>
          <li>Rewatch early Anderson films and compare their looseness to your own first works.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“It was basically the Trolley Problem, except it revealed that half the playerbase, myself included, are unabashed sociopaths and will happily flatten a town if it means getting to hang on to our main squeeze.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The game remains a parable about empathy as labor -- the cost of caring in a broken system.</li>
          <li>Its moral design invites reflection on responsibility, not winning.</li>
          <li>It continues to resonate with anyone trying to hold onto humanity in tech-mediated life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reflect on how your work asks viewers to choose -- and what those choices reveal.</li>
          <li><strong>Use interactivity metaphorically</strong>: editing is its own moral fork.</li>
          <li>Revisit endings that leave tension unresolved; trust discomfort.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“Alan's brilliant idea here was he wanted to put us (the audience) through the same test.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The essay reframes paranoia as an aesthetic -- control rendered beautiful.</li>
          <li>It historicizes how political fear becomes film grammar in the American century.</li>
          <li>The "test film" becomes metaphor for a culture rehearsing violence as normalcy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analyze your use of surveillance shots -- who's watching whom?</li>
          <li>Draw from political context; film is always evidence of its moment.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“Control, permission for use, and compensation is a fundamental right of these workers. Anything less than the protection of creators and their rights is unacceptable.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The panic around Sora 2 reveals Hollywood's dependence on technological spectacle, not storytelling labor.</li>
          <li>Agencies' "concern" masks a scramble to own creative tools rather than share them.</li>
          <li>The real risk isn't AI's power -- it's who profits from its displacement of human workers.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“_Heat 2_ isn't a sequel in the usual sense -- it's the same pulse, the same precision, but stretched across time, tracing how obsession and professionalism consume every life they touch.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The sequel's scale underscores how nostalgia fuels consolidation -- new art as brand continuity.</li>
          <li>_Heat 2_ risks polishing what was once jagged; the corporate machine reworks memory for market.</li>
          <li><strong>The deal signals a deeper truth</strong>: legacy IP now replaces mentorship as Hollywood's ladder.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“For Lu, the medium of play -- so often dismissed as mere entertainment -- becomes a vehicle for awakening, translating Buddhist philosophy into digital form.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lu Yang's work challenges the commodified self -- avatars as extensions of capitalist spectacle rather than liberation.</li>
          <li>The exhibit asks whether technological transcendence only deepens alienation from the body and labor.</li>
          <li>By collapsing digital play and spiritual imagery, the piece confronts how "immortality" has become a corporate fantasy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Think critically about how your filmmaking tools mirror systems of power -- what kind of subjects do they privilege?</li>
          <li>Create work that questions rather than celebrates "limitless creation" tech; tension is fertile.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“He never failed to capture a film's tone perfectly, often focusing heavily on its characters -- layering a sprawling ensemble cast into a single image was a Struzan specialty.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Struzan's legacy reaffirms illustration as an act of storytelling, not decoration.</li>
          <li>His compositions translated emotion into mythic imagery -- a reminder that marketing can be art when it's made by workers, not algorithms.</li>
          <li>His death marks another turn in Hollywood's shift away from tactile imagination toward digital sameness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>

          <li>Revisit Struzan's posters to study balance and texture; note how faces carry light.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“Strange Days is a noir-soaked science-fiction thriller set against a backdrop of racial tension, police brutality, sexual assault, and a disruptive new virtual reality device called a SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device).”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bigelow's punishment for ambition exposes the gendered economics of risk in Hollywood.</li>
          <li>_Strange Days_ remains prophetic about surveillance, spectacle, and voyeuristic guilt.</li>
          <li>The film's failure became a cautionary tale -- how the system disciplines creativity that critiques itself.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“It's always been a battle for me, because I'm trying to do certain things ... I have a voice.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bertino's story shows how horror directors often survive on emotional endurance, not industry grace.</li>
          <li>His reflections reveal the grind of indie horror -- a mix of isolation, resilience, and DIY ethics.</li>
          <li>The piece reframes fear as a creative resource, not just a cinematic mood.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build small horror sets; use limitation as energy, not obstacle.</li>
          <li>Journal what scares you -- and what you avoid shooting.</li>
          <li>Trade gear, not competition; resource sharing sustains longevity.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“Studio4°C and director Kenichiro Akimoto give the bleak sci-fi story a much more colorful and energetic aesthetic than Doug Liman's live-action adaptation.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The adaptation demonstrates how repetition in narrative mirrors repetition in labor -- a loop without liberation.</li>
          <li>Its militarized spectacle critiques and perpetuates the fantasy of eternal productivity.</li>
          <li>The work hints at the exhaustion beneath entertainment's polish.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Experiment with cyclical structure -- how does repetition change emotion?</li>
          <li><strong>Deconstruct your own process</strong>: what creative "loops" are you stuck in?</li>
          <li>Try cutting a short with recycled footage to explore time as a material.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“Juvenile, amoral, and quite carefree about wasting your time, Gomes's films also open up a horizon of total freedom ... his works catalyze something else: a porous, unfixed sensation of political joy.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gomes' cinema turns play into critique -- joy as rebellion against fatalism.</li>
          <li>His narratives blur myth and reportage, suggesting politics can exist in whimsy.</li>
          <li>The piece sees his work as an antidote to cynicism, without ignoring the grind of making art under austerity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Infuse your scripts with humor that bites -- laughter as structure, not relief.</li>
          <li>Let your location dictate your story; realism grows from place, not budget.</li>
          <li>Watch Gomes to study editing that feels like dreaming in daylight.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“You might say there are significantly more deep cuts in Altman's career than there are classics -- which is saying something since he has quite a few classics.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Altman's chaos was never disorder -- it was democracy rendered audible.</li>
          <li>His overlapping dialogue and ensemble focus built a cinema of coexistence.</li>
          <li>The essay frames him as a worker among workers, shaping meaning through openness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Film collective spaces -- capture how sound and speech collide.</li>
          <li>Resist narrative dominance; let background stories breathe.</li>
          <li>Rewatch _Nashville_ and study how noise becomes empathy.</li>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“What a dull chase it would have been had I stuck to what was probable.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Friedkin's work captures the tension between realism and chaos -- art born from streets, not storyboards.</li>
          <li><strong>The essay reminds readers that grit used to mean ethics</strong>: the filmmaker as chronicler, not stylist.</li>
          <li>Revisiting it now exposes how corporate action cinema sterilized danger.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Study how Friedkin choreographs chaos -- movement before meaning.</li>
          <li>Shoot handheld in public spaces to relearn risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Reclaim "gritty" as a moral stance</strong>: honesty over gloss.</li>

        <p><strong>To-Dos</strong></p>

          <li><strong>Think about how to build investment _before_ release</strong>: what stories, struggles, or creative stakes can make people feel part of your film's journey?</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Create a short scene where discomfort is the point -- not to shock, but to let an ugly truth breathe.</li>
          <li>Study how your camera reacts to shame or silence; these are the cracks where revelation hides.</li>
          <li>Build one sequence where the sacred and grotesque share the same frame.</li>

And that's this week's digest. I want to give another special shout out to all of [Dust Wave's amazing filmmakers](/about.html) -- we have a special group of creative folks that make movies no matter what. Beauty and joy is our pursuit.

I don't have a Letterboxd or anything, but here are a few movies I've watched (or rewatched) and enjoyed recently:

As always, everything we share is chosen with the same compass: **collectivity over ego, experiments over formulas, access over gatekeeping.**

Keep making what only you can make, keep passing the torch sideways, and keep stitching together the world we actually want to live in.
