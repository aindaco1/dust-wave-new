Welcome to this week’s *DIY Filmmaker Digest* — part syllabus, part mixtape, part fever dream of cinema’s shifting ground. Below you will find: essays and interviews that ask what artists are tinkering with, what systems are breaking, and how you might improvise your own way forward. There’s a mild New Mexico bias, plus podcasts, videos, and trailers to keep your queue weird and your outlook restless.  

By the way ... for those of you in Albuquerque -- go watch movies at the [Guild Cinema!](https://www.guildcinema.com) The Guild is the only independent theater left in Albuquerque, and many of the films we highlight can only be seen there on the big screen. Support indie film!

        <p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
        <ul>

        <blockquote class="mb-2">“Ryan Coogler was pitching the movie, and it's how all the great directors pitch their films — they sit down and tell someone a story. If they get you hooked and you have to hear the ending, that's a real movie.”</blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>Reflect on how genre-bending storytelling can resonate deeply with audiences.</li>
          <li>Study the way community world-building in films like _Sinners_ creates emotional stakes before the main action begins.</li>
          <li>Consider the cultural layers (music, history, politics) that can make independent projects stand out.</li>

And that's this week's digest. I want to give a special shout out to all of [Dust Wave's amazing filmmakers](/about.html) -- we have a special group of creative folks that make movies no matter what.

We have two Kickstarters coming up for future Dust Wave projects -- the first one is for [Just Hang On](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/836858424/just-hang-on-a-short-film-about-survival-choice-and-hope), [Chelsea Ambrose](https://www.instagram.com/chelseaambrosemua)'s short drama about survival, choice, and hope. Chelsea is a longtime makeup and special effects artist, but this is her first time writing and directing a short film. **[Go support Chelsea's project!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/836858424/just-hang-on-a-short-film-about-survival-choice-and-hope)**

The second launches on September 30 -- Jeanette Aguilar Harris's [Dancing Through the Darkness](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/dancing-through-the-darkness-an-alzheimers-ballet-story). [Jeanette](https://www.instagram.com/jeanetteaguilarharris) is a longtime actor and dancer and her short film is about faith, family, and the power of dance in the face of early onset Alzheimer's. **[Go support Jeanette's project!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/dancing-through-the-darkness-an-alzheimers-ballet-story)**

As always, everything we share is chosen with the same compass: **collectivity over ego, experiments over formulas, access over gatekeeping.**

Keep making what only you can make, keep passing the torch sideways, and keep stitching together the world we actually want to live in.

</br>
