The [2025 Fronteras Micro-film Festival](https://fronterasmicrofilm.com) has just received generous support from the [PASEO Project](https://paseoproject.org) and will be hosted at the [PASEO 2025](https://paseoproject.org/paseo2025) in Taos, New Mexico! The PASEO outdoor art festival brings projection, installation, and performance art to the streets of Taos every fall. This free, community-centered event features local, regional, national, and international artists with work that is site-specific, context responsive and participatory. For two nights (September 12-13), sunset to 11pm, the PASEO brings the community together with a creative and inspiring shared experience.
