If you've been following Dust Wave's exploits since August 2024, you may have noticed a few developments:
</br>

- We have launched **[7 successful crowdfunding campaigns](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/dustwave/created)** for Dust Wave short film projects! With several more planned later in 2025.


- We have **expanded the number of [events, fundraisers, and screenings](https://shop.dustwave.xyz)** we host manyfold.

And you may be asking: <i>**why?**</i> More specifically, <i>**why does Dust Wave need all this money?**</i> Valid questions, and ones that I intend to answer as thoroughly as the blog format will allow without boring folks to tears.

<br>

### Movies Cost Money
<br>

The heading says it all. Since September 2024, **we have raised $36,570 (and counting) through our [crowdfunding efforts on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/dustwave/created)** (minus platform + processing fees and taxes). **Every one of those dollars goes directly to supporting film project costs**, including but not limited to:<br><br>


- Craft services + meals
- Rentals (equipment, transportation, etc.)
- Equipment purchases
- Permits
- Location costs
- Set decoration/art
- Props
- Makeup + costumes
- Crew/cast
- Fundraising fulfillment

Something we’re proud of is **how creative we are at controlling costs.** We often cater our own productions (thank you [Tina!](https://www.instagram.com/tinatimelord)), create our own sets/props/costumes by hand, borrow equipment from our friends (big shout out to [MOOD](https://allthingsmood.com/) for their generous support), shoot in locations with minimal permit fees or other costs, and most importantly, **rely on the good will and passion of filmmakers within our collective** (and our creative friends and supporters outside of Dust Wave) to **volunteer their time and talents** to help make our projects great.

Outside of DIY outfits and collectives like Dust Wave, **the creation of *one* short film can often cost tens of thousands of dollars** — or more. And we simply don’t have access to those kinds of resources. At least *not* *yet.*

As long as I’m part of Dust Wave, **I will always advocate for a scrappy approach to our projects.** Often times, limited resources force us to get more creative. Shoot, we built a whole miniature city out of cardboard for our kaiju vs. mech film [Movie Monsters](/project/movie-monsters.html) — **we are most definitely practitioners of DIY.**

</div>
</br></br>

However, **[our ultimate goal](/about.html) is to compensate every person that contributes** their blood (rarely), sweat, and tears (perhaps less rarely) on our projects what they justly deserve — and on many projects, **crowdfunding and fundraiser events have allowed us to get closer to that goal.**

<br>

### Movies Cost Money, Pt. 2
<br>

Cool. **But what about operating costs?** For example:

- Rent
- Insurance
- Software
- Equipment
- Merchandise fulfillment
- Administration

Again, **we strive to operate frugally and efficiently.** We often purchase second-hand equipment, we screen print T-shirts ourselves, we hand code our websites and host them on [Github Pages](https://github.com/aindaco1/dust-wave-new) for free, and we use free software when possible. **Dust Wave operates as a multi-member LLC** — administrative burden is low compared to other entities, but still significant (GRT payments, annual tax filing, etc.).

Though **we don’t skimp on insurance,** our **studio rental costs are low** for the value we get from the space — it serves as a basecamp and sometimes location for our shoots, a storage space for our equipment, and a meeting place for our collective members.

But because **our crowdfunding efforts directly support projects,** and **don’t provide indirect payment for operating costs** (and we don’t charge dues to members), the **special events we host,** the **merchandise we sell,** and to a lesser extent in 2025, **grants,** are critical to **covering those operating costs.**

Events like [**Dive-In Movies**](https://diveinmovies.xyz/), **repertory screenings** at the [Guild Cinema](https://www.guildcinema.com/) and other locations, [**premiere screenings**](/project/an-evening-of-frights-and-delights.html), and [**merchandise**](https://shop.dustwave.xyz/) like our T-shirts, stickers, mugs, posters and the like, allow us to do our thing. **Thanks to our collective model** (and [our 40+ beautiful, special individuals](/about.html) that contribute their sweat), **we are able to organize, produce, promote, and staff events** and **create, sell and ship Dust Wave merchandise.** Not everything we try is fabulously successful (we try [many](/project/horse-vs-vamp.html) [weird](/project/frograiser.html) [things](project/fronteras-micro-film-festival.html)), but enough succeed to keep us going strong.

</div>
</br></br>

Ultimately, **we couldn’t do it without [our partners](/partners.html),** who clearly believe in what we’re doing, and the broader **DIY film community,** with whom we stand in solidarity.
</br></br>

### Promotion
</br>

Another benefit of doing all of these additional activities is that they serve as **natural vehicles to create awareness, to promote, and to market our film projects.** In my experience, **transparency in process is not only the right thing to do,** but also **happens to be a cogent practice.**

**We love sharing** our [fundraising campaigns](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/dustwave/created), [behind-the-scenes material](https://www.instagram.com/waveofdust), our tried-and-true approaches, and anything else we’ve learned along the way — **we hope that the material we share inspires** fellow filmmakers, artists, collectives, and organizations to make art. In large part, **I don’t see the value of competition** in this respect — **filmmaking is a global practice with a global audience.** I believe there’s **plenty of room for everyone to make their art.**

</div>
</br></br>

I also know that **in the course of sharing, we create awareness** of who we are, what we stand for, and what we make. **In an attention economy, this is critical** — I’m pretty sure that most of us want our work to be seen and connect with an audience.

So there’s that bonus effect as well. Which is pretty sweet.
</br></br>

### Access
</br>

As I mentioned before, **Dust Wave does not charge dues to our members.** I have noticed, particularly in American cinema, the **pernicious effects of [gatekeeping](https://shado-mag.com/articles/see/the-film-industry-has-a-gatekeeping-problem), [nepotism](https://cinepunx.com/jr-spielbergs-please-dont-feed-the-children-is-nepotism-run-amuck), and other barriers of access to the art of filmmaking.** Because of the expensive and time-consuming nature of the craft, **[working class folks rarely get the chance](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/lack-of-working-class-directors) to be part of that exclusive “above-the-line” club** (a term I loathe) and tell their own stories.

For many folks in Dust Wave, **crowdfunding and other kinds of grassroots fundraising** are some of the few clear paths to **seeing their ambitious filmmaking visions come to life.** I root like hell for filmmakers that **don’t have famous film industry family**, or **the right connections,** or **a fashionable but disposable or shallow ideas,** but *do* have **creativity, vision, and grit** in spades. And it seems imperative that they get the support they need from the artists and communities that share their values. When they win, well, **score one for the rest of us.**
</br></br>

</br>
</br>

I’ll go one step further and predict that **these creators,** in the shadow of a dysfunctional, sick behemoth of a film industry, **are the future of filmmaking.** <i>Or at least I can hope!</i>

We are humble enough to imagine that the way we do things is most certainly not the only way — **we take inspiration from others and remain in a permanent state of learning.** And undoubtably, as the climate changes, **we will change and adapt our methods.**

I will say though — I am often surprised by filmmakers for whom crowdfunding (or even fundraising generally) is beneath them.

<i>**“Must be nice,”**</i> I can’t help but think.

Oh well. **Onward!**
